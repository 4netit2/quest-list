# Quest List

A Todo List system based on quests in a Fantasy RPG world!

## How it works?

* Go to the [QuestList Website](http://maeva-contact.com/questlist/index.php) and **SIGN UP** to start the adventure!
* Create your character by grabing an **AVATAR** and a **CLASS**! Enter the **PSEUDO** of your choice and press **CREATE CHARACTER**! By default, you are an APE Warrior!
* You can **add quests** by pressing **ADD / REMOVE QUESTS**
* You have some **defaukt quests** you can add with the **PLUS SIGN** on the right or remove by clicking once again on the button (the **CHECK SIGN**)
* You can add your **custom quest** by entering its title in the **input field** and choosing a category by clicking in the **category icon**. Then you can add or remove those quests the same way as for default quests!
* On the main page, you can see all the quests to defeat!
* You can **defeat a quest** by clicking on the circle area on the left of the quest.
* Once defeated you cannot remove your quest in the main page! The **XP** is won! And to delete it, simple go back to the **ADD / REMOVE QUEST** popup.
* To clean your dashboard, press the **reload button** in the top center of your page (between the **QUEST DEFEATED** and **ADD / REMOVE QUEST**)
* To see your **level** and **experience** progress, take a look at the very top right of the page, in the **menu** icon!

## Version

1.0

## WARNING

**IN THE VERSION 1.0**

* Be careful when you enter your password, don't do a **typo**! There is no double check in the password and we can't send it to you by e-mail! Keep your credentials!
* Your quests **ARE NOT** saved, only your progression (level, pseudo, experience, avatar, class) is saved, but not the quests!
